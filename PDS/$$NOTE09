Hi Sam,

Here's the updated file.

While testing the IEASYMnn list, I found a bug.  If the symbol
name did not begin with SYS then it was changed to SYS...

There is a system symbol called UNIXVER and it was displaying as
blanks.  I discovered it was changed to SYSXVER.

This is corrected now and system symbols from IEASYMnn have the
correct name even when they don't begin with SYS.

I suspect there are lots of sites with their own symbols that do
NOT begin with SYS.  Now they're available via USERINFO.

I've added a comment block to the HELP for USERINFO for the
&SYSSCMD problem.  Let me know if you think it needs more.
