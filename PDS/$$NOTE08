Hi Sam,

Hope all is going well there.

I recently had a STEPLIB user from Germany mention that it showed
up in the TRACKING report when the operator commands "SETCON
TRACKING=ON" and "D OPDATA,TRACKING" are issued.  As we don't
have any EAV devices I've never paid much attention to this
information.  I recall working with it a long time ago when
debugging code that used 1 byte console ids for WTO's.  It looks
like they've updated it to track a few things now.

Anyway, while I was at it I updated a few other of the tools so
that they don't show up on this list any more.

I've attached the new version.  There's no rush in getting it
uploaded as the user from Germany is running the new version and
nobody else is complaining.

Bye for now.
Dan
