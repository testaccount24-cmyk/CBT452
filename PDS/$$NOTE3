Hi Sam,

Jan Ott from BMC notified me of a problem with my dynamic STEPLIB
command on z/OS 1.12.  We won't have it installed and running
till early next week so I haven't encountered the problem yet.

Jan was very helpful and got approval from IBM to discuss the
changes with me.  The STEPLIB storage now consists of a DCBE as
well as a DCB, so it's doubled the amount of storage that they
FREEMAIN when the job/TSU terminates.

The attached version is an update of my file with the new version
of STEPLIB that Jan has verified works with z/OS 1.12.  As I will
be able to access it next week, I'll be able to do further stress
testing but I'm fairly certain that the attached code will
resolve the problem.  If I encounter any other situation, I'll
contact you next week.

I hope you and yours are all doing well.
Thanks a lot.

Dan
