   Function:
             Replace symbols on "SET" JCL statements with their
             current values.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   All "SET" JCL statements will be scanned.

   All supported symbols will be substituted at submission time
   with the symbol's value at that time.
   As the substitution is performed by an IEFUJV exit routine it
   will perform the substition at that time on the processing
   system.  In other words, if a job is submitted on SYSTEM A and
   executes on SYSTEM B, the symbols would have been translated
   by SYSTEM A.  If you are using system dependent symbols (ie.
   &SYSNAME.) then the job must execute on the submitting lpar.
   This also goes for other variables.  The current TIME may not
   be the same on each system.  Although &ZJOBNAME. is one that
   will never change, &ZJOBID. could change if the job is passed
   to another node.

   Due to these caviots it is unlikely that IBM will ever provide
   addtional support for system symbols in batch.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Please terminate your symbols with a period.  A "blank" is
   also accepted as a terminator but it is best to use symbols
   as they are defined by IBM documentation.

   System Symbols:
     All symbols defined in IEASYMxx

     z/OS Defined:
     &SYSCLONE. &SYSNAME. &SYSPLEX. &SYSR1. &SYSR2. etc.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Addition & Subtraction Are Allowed On Numeric Internal Symbols.

   You can code:
        // SET LASTWEEK=&ZJDATE-7.
   This will give you the julian date for one week prior to today.

   The symbol name must be terminated with a "+" or "-" and the
   numeric portion should be terminated with a period.
   (ie. &YYDDD+1. or &YYDDD-07.)

   The general rule for the "Math" process is that the number will
   be in units of the symbol.

   For Example:
   &DDMMYY.,   &DDMMYYYY., &MMDDYY.,   &MMDDYYYY., &YYDDD.,
   &YYDDMM.,   &YYMMDD.,   &YYYYDDD.,  &YYYYDDMM., &YYYYMMDD.
   &ZDAY.,     &ZDOW.,     &ZJDATE.,   &ZWD.,      &ZWEEKDAY.,
   &YYYY/DDD.
   Are "Day" symbols.  The "+" or "-" value will adjust the symbol
   by the specified number of days.

   &STDYEAR.,  &ZYEAR.,
   Are "Year" symbols.  The "+" or "-" value will adjust the symbol
   by the specified number of years.

   &ZMONTH., &ZMONTHCH., And &ZMOY.
   Is a "Month" symbol.  The "+" or "-" value will adjust the symbol
   by the specified number of months.

   &HH.,
   Is an "Hour" symbol.  The "+" or "-" value will adjust the symbol
   by the specified number of hours.

   &MM.,
   Is a "Minutes" symbol.  The "+" or "-" value will adjust the symbol
   by the specified number of minutes.

   &SS.,
   Is a "Seconds" symbol.  The "+" or "-" value will adjust the symbol
   by the specified number of seconds.

   The &ZTIME., &ZTIMEL., &ZJOBNAME., &ZSMFID. And IEASYMxx
   symbols will ignore any "+" or "-" adjustment.
