//*     Many users want their own personal libraries to be          *   FILE 452
//*     allocated in front of the libraries that are allocated      *   FILE 452
//*     within the LOGON procedure. Normally, this means that       *   FILE 452
//*     the user has to re-allocate the DD, specifying all of       *   FILE 452
//*     the libraries with their own as the first library. If       *   FILE 452
//*     the libraries that are in the LOGON procedure get           *   FILE 452
//*     renamed or deleted due to maintenance, the user's           *   FILE 452
//*     allocation fails, leaving them without that specific DD     *   FILE 452
//*     allocated at ALL.  With this command, you simply let        *   FILE 452
//*     the LOGON procedure do it's thing, and in your initial      *   FILE 452
//*     logon CLIST/REXX specify the libraries you want in          *   FILE 452
//*     front. The re-allocation occurs, without the user           *   FILE 452
//*     needing to know all the LOGON procedure's library           *   FILE 452
//*     names.                                                      *   FILE 452

//*     only gets the required information, making it quite a       *   FILE 452
//*     bit faster. There are additional keywords to change how     *   FILE 452

//*     Have you ever hit SAVE in ISPF when you meant to enter      *   FILE 452
//*     CANCEL? I have. This utility allows you to get the          *   FILE 452

//*     untouched, and a new library is created with all the        *   FILE 452
//*     OLD members.  Unfortunately, this does not work on PDSE     *   FILE 452

//*     With the deficiencies of ISPLLIB, and the other             *   FILE 452

//*     or user related items within a CLIST or REXX? Of course,    *   FILE 452
//*     in a REXX EXEC, you can bounce through control blocks,      *   FILE 452
//*     but wouldn't it be easier to have it available in a         *   FILE 452
//*     defined symbol. Actually, this tool was created way         *   FILE 452
//*     back, before REXX was available, and CLIST was the way      *   FILE 452
//*     to go. With USERINFO, the system and user information is    *   FILE 452
