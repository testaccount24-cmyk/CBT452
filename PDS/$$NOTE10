Hi Sam,
This version of File 452 contains a little tool that will take an
assembled DSECT and create the appropriate BLSQMDEF/BLSQMFLD
statements required for an IPCS format model.

One of the other vendors mentioned that he did this function by
hand.  I had the beginnings of this tool but still had to do a
lot of work by hand.  This one ALMOST does it all.  Hopefully
with the other vendor using it we may get it so it DOES do it all ;-)

Hope you're well.
Cheers,
Dan
