Hi Sam,

I was contacted today to see if there were any updates to STEPLIB
for z/OS 1.13.

I checked my code and the big change was for z/OS 1.12 which was
STEPLIB version 1.16.

There were a few minor changes since then with support for JES3
sites and the addition of a &STEPLIB clist variable that can be
used after STEPLIB has been invoked.

I went to the CBT site to verify that the latest version was
there only to find that version 1.16 is on the CBT site, not the
latest 1.18.

Even though the one on the CBT site will work with z/OS 1.13,
it's best that the latest version is available to users.

Attached is the latest version of my file.

Thanks,
Dan
