                 NOTES ON HOW TO USE LWATEDIT


The LWATEDIT program was written by Dan Dalby, to make it easier to
manipulate your TSO authorization tables, just by editing them.

Ingredients:

1.  Copy the LWAEDIT1 panel to one of your ISPPLIB libraries.

2.  Assemble the LWATEDIT program.  It should NOT be APF-authorized.

3.  Assemble the LWATMGR program.  This program has to have its name
    in the AUTHCMD table (when it is used standalone) and also in the
    AUTHTSF table (so it can be called by IKJEFTSR from the LWATEDIT
    program).

4.  Issue the TSO command LWATEDIT from within ISPF.

5.  You will get the LWAEDIT1 panel, which will ask you to pick which
    table you want to edit.  Place a slash / next to the table you
    want to edit.  Press ENTER.  You will get a list of 8-character
    program names that are in the table.  Do what you want with this
    table, sort it, etc.  When you have finished, if you want to make
    the new names into a new table, enter SAVE.  Otherwise just END.

6.  If you SAVEd the table and then exit, LWATEDIT will call LWATMGR
    using IKJEFTSR (that's why LWATMGR has to be in AUTHTSF), and
    LWATMGR will update the table with your new SAVEd entries.

7.  Making a new table is easy, just edit the old one with LWATEDIT,
    change it, SAVE it, and exit.  Easy as pie.  Thanks, Dan Dalby!
