Hi Sam,

Attached is an updated version of my file.

Along with the LWATEDIT and STEPLIB changes, I've been working on
a request from Dean Tesar with reguards to my IEFUJV exit
routine.  The exit now has the capability of performing MATH on
the date symbols that it manages.  It changes a bunch of built in
variables (&symbol) that can be specified on "SET" statements,
which means they can later be used in the job's JCL.

Sample...
// SET TODAY='&YYYYDDD.'     generates TODAY='2009079'
// SET YESTERDY=&YYYYDDD-1.'  generates YESTERDY='2009078'
// SET TOMORROW='&YYYYDDD+1.'  generates TOMORROW='2009080'
It can also be used for system symbols as defined in IEASYMxx.

BTW, I'm still tracking an IBM problem with z/OS 1.11 that causes
STEPLIB to fail.  It appears to be a problem with the CIRB macro
and the STAB=(DYN) option.  I'm sure that this will be corrected
before z/OS 1.11 is shipped.

Dan
