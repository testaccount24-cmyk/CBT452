Hi Sam,

Attached is a new version of my file.  No rush to upload it as
there really aren't any changes but a few users that I've been
talking to from IBM-MAIN wanted a sample of STARTIO.  I've
resurrected some old code (1988) that reads the VOL1 label of a
DASD volume while it's OFFLINE.

In case you're interested in this tool, it is CHECKVOL which I
re-wrote as the original used an obscure message routine for
displaying the output.  This is a simple MLWTO and an optional
WTOR.  This module does nothing, it's READVOL1 that issues the
STARTIO to the specified device.  For this module I didn't really
change a thing so it's running code written long long ago...and
still works.  When this was written, our DASD management group
used this as a step before initializing a DASD volume.  They
simply ran a multi-step job with CHECKVOL as the 1st step (with
the WAIT option) and if that got a return code zero the INIT step
proceeded.  All done with COND= as the IF statement wasn't
available at the time.

Thanks and have a great summer.
Dan
