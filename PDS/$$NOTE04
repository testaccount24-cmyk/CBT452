Greetings,

For all the users of my dynamic STEPLIB command from the CBT
File 452 please be aware of a couple of situations.

On z/OS 1.11 you may encounter a D78 abend.
On z/OS 1.12 you may encounter a D0A-04 abend.

The D78 fix has been available for a while (April '09).
The D0A-04 fix has just been released.

This command was originally designed for use on TSO.  Some users
have extended the use of this command to execute in a batch TMP
environment.  Please be aware that in a batch environment STEPLIB
cleanup is not automatic.  The original STEPLIB DCB/DCBE storage
will be released but any storage acquired by the STEPLIB command
will be orphaned.  I suggest the use of "STEPLIB CLOSE" when
terminating a batch TMP step that uses STEPLIB.  Failure to do so
will cause a small amount of LSQA to be orphaned and eventually
may cause problems in the INIT.

Please contact me with any problems/suggestions.
