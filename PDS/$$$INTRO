                    MVS/JES2 Software

   -------------------------------------------------------------------

   I have been developing system software in an MVS/JES2 environment
   since 1975 and have written quite a few tools to make my life and
   those who I work with easier.
   I hope you find them useful too.

   Email me if you require further information about these tools, or
   just want to say hello. You can also email me to report bugs or
   request enhancements.  I am not promising anything but I will get
   to them as quickly as possible.

   I have other tools that I will be making available as soon as they
   are packaged, so if you're looking for something, just ask and I'll
   see if I have something that will help you out.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------

    Happy coding.
