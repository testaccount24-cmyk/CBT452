Hi Sam,

Recently, a JES3 site installed the STEPLIB command.  I've never
done much with JES3 so I don't know the minor differences.  This
site's SSIBJBID in the SSID was "J" for TSO users.  He thought
that was normal saying that they were JOBS running under TSO.
Rather than argue the fact I put in some extra code to
accommodate this situation.   Now it determines if it's a TSO
user based on the OUCB.  I suppose it could work like that for
ALL types of subsystems, but as it was working fine for JES2 why
mess with it.

Oddly enough I had another site ask about STEPLIB on a JES3 LPAR.
They were slightly confused with my internal data set names
(MVS-JES2) and thought that JES2 macros were required.  After
that was cleared up they are continuing to investigate if STEPLIB
will resolve their problems.

Here's the latest version for you to upload to the CBT site at
your leisure.

Thanks for all your work.
