)F FUNCTION -
     The ADDTO command is used to concatenate datasets to a currently
     allocated DD.  By default, the NEW datasets will be placed infront
     of the existing allocations.

     This command is useful if your installation has a "STOCK" LOGON
     procedure and users wish to add there own or group libraries to the
     current list of libraries.  With the ADDTO command it is not
     necessary for the user to reallocate the DD specifying ALL the
     libraries in the LOGON proc.  This also makes it easier for the
     SYSPROG to ADD, REMOVE or RENAME libraries in the LOGON procedure.

     In case you want to re-allocate the DD back to it's original list
     of datasets, a variable called &ADDTO is created with the comma
     separated list of data set names.

     Note: If "LAST" is specified the datasets currently allocated to
           the specified DD are NOT reallocated.  The new datasets are
           simply added to the end.
           If an error is encountered please add the "VERBOSE" keyword
           to see if any error message is issued.

     REQUIRED  - ddname and library list

     DEFAULTS  - FIRST

     EXAMPLE   - ADDTO SYSPROC (MY.CLIST 'YOUR.CLIST')
)O OPERANDS
     ddname       - The DDNAME which you wish to extend.
     library list - A single dataset name, or a list of names enclosed
                    within brackets.
                    If the dataset name is not within quotes, it will
                    be assume that it is the for the current users's
                    prefix.
     FIRST        - Add the specified datasets before the datasets
                    currently allocated to the DD.
     LAST         - Add the specified datasets after the datasets
                    currently allocated to the DD.
     REMOVE       - Remove the "library list" from the concatenation.
     VERBOSE      - Messages will be issued for each request.
